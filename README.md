# Advance-python-example
This project contains the code from the [Bryan](https://voidrealms.com)'s [Advance Python Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdn9_MZ0lN4), which is a very great series.

It mainly introduces the decorator, pickle, Threads/MultiThreads/ThreadsPool, Processing/MultiProcessing/ProcessingPool, async,  TCP/UDP socket and blocking/unblocking
## Notice
- Not all the code from the tutorial are contained, but most of them are here with slightly modification

- The code is based on the win32, so the telnet need to be opened manually on the control panel

- In order to see the logging info, run it on the terminal if using pycharm
